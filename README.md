================
Twitter on Rails is a `rails` based application, by which
you will be able to search for the tweets by a given search handle.

Goals:

- [ ] Deploy the application to Heroku (free app)

Stretch Goals:
--------------
- [ ] Write specs/tests!
- [ ] Cache identical API calls for ~5 mins
- [ ] Parse @mentions in tweets and link those to the status pages
- [ ] Anything else cool that you can think of

Submission Guidelines:

Create a Readme file within the repository that contains the following:
- [ ] Brief walk-through of app design / choices made
- [ ] Local environment setup instructions
- [ ] Test suite setup/execution instructions (if applicable)
- [ ] Email links of the public GitHub repo and live Heroku application to dev-challenge@stackcommerce.com
